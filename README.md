* 👋 Hi, I’m @ju-li
* 🏗 I’m currently building Krinu @ https://www.krinu.com - a sales enablement tool that connects your messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and iMessage with your CRM. So that you can connect with customers and partners using your favorite messaging apps but log and collaborate on these interactions using your CRM.

    * Previously built https://tripli.com and https://getbuylo.com - interviewed with YCombinator for both

    * Was a consultant at Analysis Group, a top Economics Consulting firm
